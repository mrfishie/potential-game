## a game by tom

This is the source code to Potential, a game developed in 2014 for a school assignment. I am posting this publicly solely for archival purposes, and do not plan on working or maintaining this any further.

The original game created for the assignment included multiple audio tracks created by Magnus Palsson for the game VVVVVV - these were not used under permission, and have been removed from this repo. The game will probably not run without these, or will run with a reduced user experience.

A clip of this game being played can be found [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/a8BbyBz8EXY).
